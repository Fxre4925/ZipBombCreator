### ZipBombCreator ###

# usage : 

.\ZipBombCreator.cmd outputname filetobase depth count [ temp ]

-outputname is the file it will output to, add no extension

-filetobase is the file it will start with, add no extension, need to be a zip

-depth is the ammount of layer in the bomb

-count is the ammount of copy in each "depth"

-temp is optional but usefull if you use a ramdisk as a tempfile, need to add the \ at the end

it is not very optimised (yet) so it will take lot of time
